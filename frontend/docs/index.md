# Design System Guidelines

Welcome to the Design System Guidelines. This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on using our design system to create consistent, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces.

## Getting Started

Our design system is built on a foundation of design tokens, components, and patterns that work together to create cohesive experiences across all platforms.

### Key Principles

- **Consistency**: Use standardized components and patterns
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all designs meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Scalability**: Design with growth and change in mind
- **Clarity**: Make interfaces intuitive and easy to understand
