# Components

Our component library provides reusable, accessible UI components built on our design tokens.

## Component Principles

- **Consistency**: All components follow the same design patterns
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind
- **Composability**: Components can be combined to create complex interfaces
- **Documentation**: Each component includes usage examples and guidelines
