# Design Principles

Our design principles guide decision-making and ensure consistency across all design work.

## Consistency

Maintain visual and functional consistency across all interfaces. Use standardized components, patterns, and design tokens to create cohesive experiences.

## Accessibility

Design for everyone. Ensure all interfaces meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and are usable by people with diverse abilities.

## Clarity

Make interfaces intuitive and easy to understand. Use clear language, appropriate visual hierarchy, and helpful feedback.

## Efficiency

Design workflows that help users accomplish tasks quickly and effectively. Minimize cognitive load and unnecessary steps.

## Scalability

Design with growth in mind. Create systems and patterns that can adapt to changing needs and scale across different contexts.

## User-Centered

Put users at the center of design decisions. Understand their needs, goals, and contexts to create meaningful experiences.
