## PART 1: WHY A DESIGN SYSTEM?

---

## Slide 3: The Challenge We're Solving
**The Problem:**
- Multiple teams building similar components in isolation
- Inconsistent user experiences across capabilities
- Duplicated effort and wasted resources
- Accessibility and compliance gaps
- Slow time-to-market for new features

**The Impact:**
- Fragmented user experience
- Higher maintenance costs
- Increased risk of compliance issues
- Slower mission delivery

---

## Slide 4: What is a Design System?
**A Design System is:**
- A shared language for design and development
- A library of reusable components and patterns
- Guidelines and standards for consistency
- Tools and processes for collaboration
- Governance and compliance enforcement

**It's NOT:**
- Just a component library
- A design style guide
- A one-time project
- A constraint on creativity

---

## Slide 5: The Value Proposition
**Build Faster**
- Pre-built components reduce development time
- Teams ship features faster while maintaining quality
- Less time on repetitive tasks, more on innovation

**Ensure Consistency**
- Unified experience across all products and platforms
- Builds trust and reduces cognitive load for users
- Professional, cohesive brand presence

**Maintain Quality**
- Built-in accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance optimizations
- Best practices enforced from day one

---

## Slide 6: Mission Alignment
**How Design Systems Support Mission Outcomes:**

1. **Faster Delivery** → More capabilities reach users sooner
